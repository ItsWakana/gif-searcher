# gif-searcher

This was my first mini-project working with some async code using the fetch api to fetch data from an external api (in this case giphy). 

The app was very simple to make, once I fetched the correct object from giphy using the fetch method I was able to deconstruct the object to obtain the URL i needed to display on my image element. After that I just called my fetch gif method each time the user clicks the button and it takes in their input.
